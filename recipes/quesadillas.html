    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Adobo seasoning to taste</li>
        <li>12 flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 can sliced black olives, drained</li>
        <li>1 can diced green chilies, drained</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the chicken on a plate, and sprinkle with adobo seasoning on both sides. 
            Let it marinate for 15 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat grill for medium-high heat. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly oil the grill grate. Place chicken on grill, 
            and cook for 10 minutes per side, or until juices run clear. 
            Remove chicken from grill, and cut into bite-size pieces. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Place one or two tortillas on the grill, and sprinkle with a thin layer of cheese, chicken, onion, olives, and chiles. 
            Top with another tortilla, and grill until brown and crispy on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. 
            Repeat with remaining ingredients. Cut into wedges to serve.
